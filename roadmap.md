# D&D Character Sheet App
## Overview
This application will allow users to create, save, and manage D&D character sheets similar to D&D Beyond. The app will include a blank page for when there are no sheets saved, prompting the user to create a new character. Each sheet will include the character's level, six main stats, a list of skills, inventory, class description, and more.

## Roadmap
### Step 1: Project Setup
- Set up a new project repository
- Initialize a new Node.js project with npm
- Set up a basic Express server
- Set up a React app for the frontend
### Step 2: Database Design
- Design a database schema for the character sheets
- Implement the schema using a database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
### Step 3: Backend Development
- Implement routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting character sheets
-Implement authentication and authorization if needed
### Step 4: Frontend Development
- Create a React component for the character sheet form
- Implement state management for the form
- Create a React component for displaying a list of saved character sheets
- Implement routing to navigate between different views
# Step 5: Testing
- Write unit tests for the backend routes
- Write unit tests for the React components
### Step 6: Deployment
- Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., Heroku)
- Deploy the frontend to a static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify)
### Step 7: Future Enhancements
- Add more features as needed (e.g., multi-user support, advanced character customization)
